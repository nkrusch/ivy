# How to Contribute

We are glad that you want to bring your improvements back to the Ivy repository! Let it be more utility functions, a new backend connector, more stylish or usable documentation – we are happy to include everything that is reusable for other sensor networks in the Ivy boilerplate. Contributors must adhere to the [Code of Conduct](/contributing/code-of-conduct).

The [Getting Started Guide] mentions, how to set up a working dev environment, test your code, and tag new releases.

## Ways of Interaction

**Bug reports:** please open an [issue](https://github.com/tum-esm/ivy/issues/new?template=bug-report.yaml) describing the bug with as much context as possible.<br/>
**Concrete improvements:** please open an [issue](https://github.com/tum-esm/ivy/issues/new?template=improvement.yaml) describing your idea.<br/>
**General communication:** if you want to discuss about a feature idea, brainstorm how to solve a certain sensor network issue, or have questions about how to use ivy, feel free to open up a [discussion](github.com/tum-esm/ivy/discussions)

Please check whether a the issue/topic already exists before opening up a new one. If we don't react within 1-2 weeks, please ping @dostuffthatmatters or email us at [moritz.makowski@tum.de](mailto:moritz.makowski@tum.de).

## Hardware Specific Code

We are open to include hardware-specific code in an [issue](https://github.com/tum-esm/ivy/issues/new/choose), in the Ivy boilerplate if it is about a common hardware interface – e.g. e popular temperature sensor or PLC. The main criterion is its reusability and its hardware-specific dependencies. If it requires a vendor-specific dependency that would complicate resolving the remaining Ivy dependencies, we would prefer to avoid it. Alternatively, we are happy to link your repository in Ivy's documentation.

## Commits and Pull Requests

Please open an issue before submitting a pull request. Mention the issue in the pull request. Mention an issue that you are addressing in the commit message:

```txt

description of this commit
```

Minor updates, like small changes in the documentation, do not require an issue or a commit description.

## Coding Conventions

- Optimize for readability
- All code must have static type annotations and pass strict [Mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)
- All pull requests must pass the CI tests
- Be very careful about including large files (like documentation images) in the codebase
- Use [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for formatting
- Keep the settings for pytest/ruff/mypy/etc. in the `pyproject.toml` file, not separate config files

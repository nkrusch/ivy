# What is an IoT Backend?

In our context, an IoT backend is a server that receives data from sensor nodes and stores it in a central database. It also sends parameter updates to the sensor nodes. This bidirectional communication can be implemented via MQTT, AMQP, Web Sockets, or any other publish-subscribe messaging protocols.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡" type="info">
  If you don't need parameter changes to be applied by the sensor nodes
  instantly, you could also use a standard REST API, where sensor nodes â€“ which
  are not directly addressable in this case â€“ regularly fetch the latest
  parameters from the backend.

Ivy supports two backends out of the box: Thingsboard [@thingsboard] and Tenta [@tenta]. It uses the MQTT protocol to communicate with them. These backends are run as regular procedures â€“ they run in a thread and are started by the mainloop on DAS startup.

You can take a look at `src/backend/` to see how these two backends are implemented. We are happy to include additional backends in the Ivy template and, of course, list you as a contributor.

Take a look at the [Configuration API Reference](/api-reference/configuration) for all options to configure the communication with the backend.

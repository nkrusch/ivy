TODO: Local file layout


From the old docstring:

1. Check whether this config revision has already been processed.
2. If version is equal to the current version:
    * Parse the received config file string using
        `types.Config.load_from_string`
    * If the received config is equal to the current
        config, do nothing
    * Otherwise, dump the received config to the config
        file path and exit with status code 0
3. Otherwise:
    * Download the source code of the new version
    * Create a virtual environment
    * Install dependencies
    * Dump the received config to the config file path
    * Run the integration pytests
    * Update the cli pointer
    * Exit with status code 0

If any of the steps above fails, log the error and return. The
automation will continue with the current config. If the pytests
of the software version to be updated make sure, that the software
runs correctly, it is not possible to update to a new version, that
does not work.

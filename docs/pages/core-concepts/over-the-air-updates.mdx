## Over-The-Air updates

Ivy runs using a `config.json` file. This config can be changed remotely. A change of configuration can either be a "reconfiguration" or a "version change". Ivy runs a suite of pytests on the local machine before switching to a new config/version. In case of a version change, it will download the required source code, install the new dependencies and remove old dependencies after a successful change.

TODO: Mention config types and foreign config types
TODO: Mention local file layout
TODO: Mention the steps below

If any of the steps above fail, Ivy will log why the config change failed and continue running the current config. The test suite should ensure that an upgrade will only happen when the local device is able to run Ivy with that new config file.

From the old docstring:

1. Check whether this config revision has already been processed.
2. If version is equal to the current version:
    * Parse the received config file string using
        `types.Config.load_from_string`
    * If the received config is equal to the current
        config, do nothing
    * Otherwise, dump the received config to the config
        file path and exit with status code 0
3. Otherwise:
    * Download the source code of the new version
    * Create a virtual environment
    * Install dependencies
    * Dump the received config to the config file path
    * Run the integration pytests
    * Update the cli pointer
    * Exit with status code 0

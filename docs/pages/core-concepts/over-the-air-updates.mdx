## Over-the-Air Updates

Ivy runs using a `config.json` file. This config can be changed remotely. A change of configuration can either be a "reconfiguration" or a "version change". Ivy runs a suite of pytests on the local machine before switching to a new config/version. In case of a version change, it will download the required source code, install the new dependencies and remove old dependencies after a successful change.

### "Config" vs. "Foreign Config"

There is two types of configurations schemas:

1. Config - the schema that the current version of your DAS requires to run: [see API reference](/api-reference/configuration#configjson)
2. Foreign Config - the schema that is required by any configuration that the current DAS version should upgrade to.

This means, you can change almost the entire structure of your config when developing a new DAS version - you only have to keep the fields `general.config_revision` and `general.software_version`.

### Update Steps

Whenever a new config comes, the updater executes the following steps:

1. Check whether this config revision has already been processed.
2. If version is equal to the current version:
   - Parse the received config file string using `types.Config.load_from_string`
   - If the received config is equal to the current config:
     - do nothing
   - Otherwise:
     - dump the received config to the config file path
     - exit with status code 0
3. If version is **not** equal to the current version:
   - Download the source code of the new version
   - Create a new virtual environment (in the new version's subdirectory)
   - Install dependencies using `pdm sync`
   - Dump the received config to the config file path
   - Run the pytests for the pytest marker `integration`
   - Update the cli pointer
   - Exit with status code 0

Hence, when it is a _reconfiguration_, the new config will be accepted if it passes the config validation. When it is a _version change_, it will only be accepted if all pytests with the pytest mark `integration` pass on the local device. Feel free to add more tests in `tests/integration/`.

If any of the steps above fail, Ivy will log why the config change failed and continue running the current config. The test suite should ensure that an upgrade will only happen when the local device is able to run Ivy with that new config file.

<Callout type="info">

The updater stops the automation when a new config has been accepted. Using the cron daemon as described [here](/core-concepts/file-system-layout#startingstopping-ivy-automatically) will start up the automation with the new config/version.

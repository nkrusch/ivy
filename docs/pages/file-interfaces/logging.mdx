# Logging

Logs will be written locally to `data/logs/`. There is one file `YYYY-MM-DD.log"` per day. The file name relates to the system date (not UTC date).

## How to log things

Log lines can have multiple levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `EXCEPTION`. The following code snippet instantiates a logger and writes some log lines.

```python
import src

config = src.types.Config.load()
logger = src.utils.Logger(config, origin="some-place")

logger.debug("Hello World!")
logger.info("Hello again!", details="Some verbose comments or data that does not fit in a subject line")
logger.warning("Something is not right!")
logger.error("Something is really wrong!")
try:
    4 / 0
except Exception as e:
    logger.exception(e, label="Failed while doing X")
```

## Where do those logs go?

The config has a section "logging_verbosity", where you can define the minimum levels for: 1. printing to console, 2. writing to log files, 3. sending as messages (see next section).

E.g. if `logging_verbosity.console_prints` is set to `WARNING`, then only `WARNING`, `ERROR` and `EXCEPTION` will be printed to console. If it is set to `null`, then nothing will be printed to console.

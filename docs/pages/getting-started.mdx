# Getting Started

**1. Use the Ivy repository as a template to create a new repository for your own DAS**

<img src="/use-template-button.png" class="mt-2" />

**2. Clone your repository to your local machine**
    
    Replace `myorg`, `myivy`, and `1.0.0` with your GitHub organization/user name, repository name, and the version you want to start with.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/myorg/myivy ~/Documents/myivy/1.0.0
    ```

    Also update these values in `config/config.template.json` and `src/constants.py`.

**3. Navigate to the cloned directory and set up a virtual environment**

    ```bash
    cd ~/Documents/myivy/1.0.0
    python3.12 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

**4. Install the project dev dependencies**

```bash
# using pip
pip install ".[dev]"

# or pdm
pdm sync --with dev

# or uv
uv sync --extra dev
```

**5. Configure your local DAS**

Use the `config/config.template.json` file as a starting point to create your own `config/config.json` file. Use https://tum-esm-ivy.netlify.app/api-reference/configuration as a reference to see all available configuration options.

```bash
cp config/config.template.json config/config.json
# now edit config/config.json
```

**6. Run the pytest cases to check your Setup**

```python
# check the tool in general
pytest tests -m quick

# check the connection to the backend, to the repository and the local config
pytest tests -m integration
```

**6. Run the local DAS**

```bash
# in the foreground
python run.py

# or the background
python cli.py start
```

**7. Observe the outputs of the system**

You can see the output of your DAS in `data/logs` and `data/messages`.

If you have set up a backend then you can observe the data and logs being published to the MQTT server:

* For Tenta: `logs/{system_identifier}` and `measurements/{system_identifier}`
* For ThingsBoard: `v1/devices/me/telemetry`

This page describes how to set up one of these backends: https://tum-esm-ivy.netlify.app/backends/general

**8. Update and build the documentation**

The documentation is located in `docs`, organized using [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) and set up using [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

```bash
cd docs

# install dependencies (`npm install` also works)
bun install

# start a local development server
bun run dev
```

Build and publish the documentation on a static site hosting service:

```bash
bun run build
```

The static build is contained in `docs/out`.

**9. Add your sensor-network specific code to the DAS**

Get yourself familiar with the documentation on the [core concepts of Ivy](https://tum-esm-ivy.netlify.app/concepts/file-system-layout), [its interfaces](https://tum-esm-ivy.netlify.app/interfaces/configuration), and how it connects to [IoT Backends](https://tum-esm-ivy.netlify.app/backends/general). You can start with the [overview section](https://tum-esm-ivy.netlify.app/overview) giving you a brief description of the different components of Ivy. 

Ivy is made to be owned, so feel free to strip away everything you don't use. You can remove the Ivy-specific parts of the documentation and just link to the central Ivy documentation (https://tum-esm-ivy.netlify.app/). We are happy to include your additions to the Ivy template - and of course list you as a contributor.

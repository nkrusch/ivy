# Configuration Files

## How to configure the automation

The file `config.json` is used to configure the whol automation. They are located inside the `config` directory, alonside with a template file that can be used to create a new configuration file.

```
📁 config
├── 📄 config.json
├── 📄 config.template.json
```

Below, you can find an example file and the schema definition of the config file. Whenever you try to start the automation with a config that does not comply with this schema, the automation will output a precise error message and shut down.

{/* The following example is synced automatically with the file in `config/config.template.json` whenever running the config schema export. */}

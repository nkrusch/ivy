# Documentation

## Overview

The docs are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and built with [Nextra](https://nextra.site/). Inside the `docs/` directory, you can run the following commands:

```bash
# install the dependencies required to build the documentation
bun install

# start the development server
bun run dev

# build the production version of the documentation
bun run build
```

When building the documentation, static HTML files are generated in the `out/` directory. You can deploy these files to any static hosting provider, such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## Automatic API Reference Syncing

Part of the documentation is not written by hand, but automatically generated from the source code. This part can be found in the API reference section. Running `python docs/scripts/sync.py` will update the respective files using the local source code. This includes:

- Copying the contents of the `README.md` file to `docs/pages/index.mdx`
- Generate a JSON Schema for each JSON file, the codebase interacts with (configuration, etc.), and save it to `docs/components/schemas/`
- Copy the contents of `config/config.template.json` to the blocks inside `docs/pages/file-interfaces/configuration.mdx` and `docs/pages/api-reference/configuration.mdx`

Before releasing a version, please run the script `docs/scripts/sync.py` to sync the API reference. There is a pytest (`tests/repository/test_api_reference_sync.py`) that fails, if the API reference is not up to date.

## How to Host Versioned Documentation

The interfaces of your codebase and the schema of the files interacting with it (configuration, state, message archive) will most likely change over time. And since not all of your systems will run the latest software version or you might want to roll back to a previous version, it is nice to have documentation of old versions accessible.

The interfaces should not change between patch versions (e.g. `1.0.0` to `1.0.1` or `0.1.5` to `0.1.6`), that is why there should be one documentation per minor version (e.g. `0.1`, `0.2`, `1.0`, `1.1` ...). This template includes a GitHub Action that will checkout a branch named `docs-vX.Y` for every tag you push to GitHub. When you push the tags `v0.1.0`, then `v0.1.1`, then `v0.1.2` and so on, the action will keep the respective `docs-v0.1` branch up to date.

You can deploy multiple branches by using "Branch Deploys" on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or "Preview Deployments" on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

The dropdown in the documentation's navigation bar is controlled in the file `docs/pages/_meta.json`:

```json
{
  "Versions": {
    "title": "Versions",
    "type": "menu",
    "items": {
      "latest": {
        "title": "Latest",
        "href": "https://ivy-docs.pages.dev/"
      },
      "v0.2": {
        "title": "v0.2",
        "href": "https://docs-v0-2.ivy-docs.pages.dev/"
      },
      "v0.1": {
        "title": "v0.1",
        "href": "https://docs-v0-1.ivy-docs.pages.dev/"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

I don't want to automate this `_meta.json` file generation to give the developer control over it. You can still automate it for your setup. URL's (`/v1.0`, `/v1.1`) instead of different subdomains (`docs-v1-0.ivy-docs.pages.dev`) would lead to a more complex setup that the one described above.

The documenation framework we are using, [Nextra](https://nextra.site/), might support this [in the future](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/issues/1421), but for does not suggest a way to do it.

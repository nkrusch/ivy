# State

The state is stored at `data/state.json`. The exact schema of this file is defined by `src.types.State` and documented [in the API Reference section](/api-reference/internal-communication).

You can simply use the `StateInterface` to interact with it from the codebase:

```python
import src

# read the state
state = src.utils.StateInterface.load()

# update the state
with src.utils.StateInterface.update() as state:
    state.system.last_boot_time = last_boot_time
    state.system.last_5_min_load = load_last_5_min
```

<Callout type="info">

The `with ... as state:` construct makes sure, that the code inside is protected by a semaphore, i.e., no other code can access the state while you are updating it.

</Callout>
